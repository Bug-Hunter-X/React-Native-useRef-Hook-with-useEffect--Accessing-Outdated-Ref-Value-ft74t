This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a functional component that also uses the `useEffect` hook.  The problem arises when trying to access the ref's current value within a function called from `useEffect`. Because `useEffect`'s callback might be called asynchronously, or during a render that's different from when the ref was last updated, using the `current` property of the ref can result in accessing an outdated value or a `null` value.
