## React Native useRef Hook with useEffect: Accessing Outdated Ref Value

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with the `useEffect` hook.  The problem arises from attempting to access the ref's current value within an effect callback, where the ref's value may not have been updated yet. 

The `BuggyRef.js` file shows how this issue results in accessing an outdated or `null` value.  The `FixedRef.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle this, ensuring the ref's value is up-to-date when accessed within the effect. 

### How to Reproduce:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run either `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios` depending on your platform.
4. Observe the behavior in the app.
